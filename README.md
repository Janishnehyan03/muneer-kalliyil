# Step-by-Step Guide to Clone and Sync a GitHub Repository Using VS Code

## Prerequisites
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine.
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- A GitHub account with access to a repository.

## Step 1: Open VS Code
1. Launch **Visual Studio Code** from your desktop or search bar.

## Step 2: Open Command Palette
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) to open the **Command Palette**.

## Step 3: Clone the GitHub Repository
1. In the Command Palette, type `Git: Clone` and select it.
2. You will be prompted to enter the repository URL. Paste the GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).
3. Select a folder on your local machine where you want to clone the repository.

## Step 4: Open the Cloned Repository
1. After cloning, VS Code will ask if you want to open the repository. Click **Open**.
2. Your repository's files will now be available in the VS Code Explorer pane.

## Step 5: Make Changes to Your Code
1. Edit your files using VS Code's editor.
2. After editing, save your changes (`Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`).

## Step 6: Stage Changes
1. In the **Source Control** tab (icon on the left sidebar), you will see your modified files under **Changes**.
2. To stage changes, hover over the file and click the **+** icon, or click **Stage All Changes** (the checkmark button) at the top.

## Step 7: Commit Changes
1. After staging, you'll need to commit the changes.
2. In the Source Control panel, type a descriptive commit message in the text box at the top.
3. Press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac) to commit.

## Step 8: Sync Changes with GitHub
1. Once the changes are committed, you need to sync them with GitHub.
2. At the bottom left of VS Code, click on the **Sync Changes** icon (circular arrows) to push your commits to GitHub.
3. If prompted for your GitHub credentials, log in.

## Step 9: Confirm Sync

2. You can verify this by visiting your repository on GitHub.
