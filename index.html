            I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Masters’ Union. I completed 
            my PhD in Economics from the Indian Institute of 
            Management Bangalore, with a specialization in the Economics of Education. 
            In 2022-2023, I was selected for a DAAD-funded PhD Exchange Program in Germany. Before
            joining IIM Bangalore, I worked as a Research Fellow at UNICEF
            India. I obtained an MPhil degree in Planning and Development from
            the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and a Masters in
            Economics from JMI, Delhi. My research interest lies in Economics of
            Education, Political Economy, and Development Economics.

                  This study examines how restricted access to microfinance by
                  households affects children’s learning outcomes, utilizing a
                  unique natural experiment that halted all microfinance
                  operations in Andhra Pradesh (AP), India, in 2010. The
                  analysis exploits quasi-random variation in district-level
                  exposure to the shock in states other than AP, as the
                  regulation affected lenders’ liquidity nationwide. We use
                  difference-in-differences and event study designs to identify
                  the causal effects of the shock. The findings reveal a
                  significant and persistent decline in children’s learning
                  outcomes, likely driven by reduced household education
                  expenditure, a shift from private to government schooling, and
                  decreased food expenditure affecting nutrition. Contrary to
                  expectations, the restoration of credit access does not fully
                  reverse these effects, highlighting the long-term consequences
                  of short-term financial disruptions. Additionally, the impacts
                  vary by gender and age, highlighting the need for targeted
                  recovery policies. By focusing on the effects of regulatory
                  restrictions rather than microfinance service provision, this
                  study complements existing literature and provides a more
                  comprehensive understanding of the socioeconomic impacts of
                  microfinance.

                  This study examines the impact of Jharkhand’s 2017-18 school
                  consolidation policy, which led to the closure of many
                  sub-standard government schools. Students were reassigned to
