            I am a doctoral candidate in the economics department at the Indian
            Institute of Management (IIM) Bangalore, India. In 2022-2023, I was
            selected for a DAAD-funded PhD Exchange Program in Germany. Before
            joining IIM Bangalore, I worked as a Research Fellow at U UNICEF
            India. I obtained an MPhil degree in Planning and Development from
            the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and a Masters in
            Economics from JMI, Delhi. My research interest lies in Economics of
            Education, Political Economy, and Development Economics.

                  This paper investigates the role of political favouritism in
                  the private education market. Using a close election
                  regression discontinuity design, we estimate the causal effect
                  of having a ruling party aligned politician on the growth of
                  private educational institutions in India. We utilize
                  constituency-level panel data on private and government
                  educational institutions matched with the electoral outcomes
                  of all state assembly elections held between 2005 and 2016. We
                  find that constituencies represented by politicians aligned
                  with the state ruling party have a higher growth rate in the
                  number of private schools compared to those with non-aligned
                  representatives. However, we do not observe any significant
                  effect on the growth rate of government schools. Similar
                  patterns are also found for higher education institutions. Our
                  analysis suggests that the driving mechanism behind this
                  phenomenon may lie in political influence over bureaucratic
                  processes and discrepancies in the enforcement of government
                  regulations. Furthermore, our result shows that these private
                  schools may not necessarily offer better quality education.

                  Does Restricting Access to Credit Impact Learning Outcomes?
                  Evidence from a Regulatory Ban on Microfinance in India (with

                  This study examines how restricted access to microfinance by
                  households affects children’s learning outcomes, utilizing a
                  unique natural experiment that halted all microfinance
                  operations in Andhra Pradesh (AP), India, in 2010. The
                  analysis exploits quasi-random variation in district-level
                  exposure to the shock in states other than AP, as the
                  regulation affected lenders’ liquidity nationwide. We use
                  difference-in-differences and event study designs to identify
                  the causal effects of the shock. The findings reveal a
                  significant and persistent decline in children’s learning
                  outcomes, likely driven by reduced household education
                  expenditure, a shift from private to government schooling, and
                  decreased food expenditure affecting nutrition. Contrary to
                  expectations, the restoration of credit access does not fully
                  reverse these effects, highlighting the long-term consequences
                  of short-term financial disruptions. Additionally, the impacts
                  vary by gender and age, highlighting the need for targeted
                  recovery policies. By focusing on the effects of regulatory
                  restrictions rather than microfinance service provision, this
                  study complements existing literature and provides a more
                  comprehensive understanding of the socioeconomic impacts of
                  microfinance.
